          <p> The Metrocard is a magnetic stripe card used for fare payment
            on transportation in the New York City area. </p>

        <div class="box2">
          <img width="70%"; src="images/tokens.jpg">
          <p> The system was first proposed by the Metropolitan Transportation
            Authority in 1983 then designed in 1992 to eliminate the burden of
            carrying tokens on the subway.

          <p> In 2016, the average weekday ridership was 5.6 million.
            Annual ridership was 1.757 BILLION. </p>

          <p> The design considers accessibility to
            the user. For example, every Metrocard has
            a slanted edge and hole. The slanted edge indicates the direction of
            the card to the visually impaired.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="box5">
          <img width="70%"; src="images/swipe.jpeg">
          <p> The hole towards the bottom left is used by the internal mechanism
            of fareboxes on buses for alignment and timing purposes as the card
            is pulled in and pushed back out. Each MetroCard slot in buses
            has a rubber grip and pin that goes in the hole to swipe the card up
            and down. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="box6">
          <img width="70%"; src="images/slow.jpg">
          <p> Therefore, as the user holds the card in the right direction, they
            then swipe with moderate speed through the card reader. As the machine
            is designed to gather all information fairly quickly, one must not
            swipe either too quickly or slowly.
