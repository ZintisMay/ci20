      // one letter is easier to write than a whole word

  //michael= "while" and "for" are two types of loops
  // global variables can be accesses anywhere in code
  // local code is within specific range

  // "++" is shorthand for i + 1
  // "--" is shorthand for i - 1
  // "==" is a question. does this = this? does i
  // for (var i=0; i < header.length; ++ ) {
// }
