open a terminal window

cd into the project directory

php -S localhost:8000

from now on type into the browser
localhost:8000
this relates to your folder
if you need to open a certain file,
append the filename after localhost:8000/loadJson.html

** but if you upload it to gihub pathway the internet is now the server so you don't need local localhost
it didn't work before when you raw opened the index.html because it had no server. Hence the CORS error.
